Here's the entirety of the Twitter clone program written by following the Ruby on Rails 3 Tutorial by Michael Hartl.

It took two weeks to complete and represents my first real immersion into the Rails framework. Now that I have a bit of
a base, it's time for me to start implementing my own ideas into another app using my notes and this experience together
as a guideline.
